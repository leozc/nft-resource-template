# nft-resource-template
This is the resource template for building NFT resources hierarchy
I use [Aruploader](https://github.com/CalebEverett/arloader) to upload these resources.
Json file is in the format of [ERC-1155 metadata uri schema](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#erc-1155-metadata-uri-json-schema)

For each Json file, the following fields are managed by the uploader
> `image`, `properties.files`
